# Loan-Prediction-ML
Using Machine Learning techniques and models, I predict the eligibility of bank customers for loan approval. This project has solid use case in banking, banks can automate the loan application procedure using a model like this, that way, customers fill up certain details and the model automatically calculates their eligibility. In this project, I have used various techniques.

Techniques used in the project include: 
1. Data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib, samples below;

2. Missing data handling, 
3. Categorical data encoding, and 
4. Machine Learning model building.

Machine learning models used are - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.

Conclusion
* There's a positive relationship between applicant income & loan amount.
* There's also a positive relationship between credit history and loan status.
* On average, men got more loans. Being married & educated (graduate) were also factors that resulted in loan approvals.
* For our ML model, at 84% accuracy, the Logistic Regression model is the most suitable to make this prediction.
